What is Infrastructure as Code Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the creation, provisioning and configuration of software-defined compute (SDC), network and storage infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC automates the manual tasks usually associated with computing infrastructure configuration and implementation. By doing this, you can: Speed up configuration and implementation of new computing infrastructure Reduce the cost and resource needed to scale and manage large infrastructure Eliminate the inconsistencies that inevitably occur when multiple individuals manually configure new equipment or applications. The core concepts of Infrastructure as Code are: Defined in code Stored in a repository Declarative or Imperative Idempotence and Consistency Push or Pull Main Benefits of Infrastructure as Code: Fully automated deployment Consistent environments Repeatable process Reusable components (\"DRY\") Documented Architecture What is Infrastructure as Code Testing Infrastructure as Code testing examines configuration definitions and scripts used to instantiate infrastructure to ensure the resulting resources are secure. IaC security testing tools must be able to consume configuration files and scripts in relevant formats, apply tests to ensure conformance with common configuration hardening standards (i.e., Center for Internet Security Benchmarks and many others), identify security issues associated with specific operational environments, identify embedded secrets, and perform other tests supporting organization-specific standards and compliance requirements. Optionally, tools can automatically remediate errors (e.g., changing read/write permissions on storage resources). This capability specifically examines IaC testing in the context of the development process, however tools may also support examination of deployed production instances and responding to issues identified in those systems.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-checkmarx","text":"Checkmarx is the global leader in software security solutions for modern enterprise software development.

It builds up a policy and defines the result. The policy builds the pattern that breaks the security of the infrastructure code and which the query is looking for. The result defines the specific data used to present the vulnerability in the infrastructure code. Metadata Each query has a metadata.json companion file with all the relevant information about the vulnerability , including the severity, category and its description. For example, the JSON code above is the metadata corresponding to the query in the beginning of this document. { \"id\": \"5738faf3-3fe6-4614-a93d-f0003242d4f9\", \"queryName\": \"All Users Group Gets Read Access\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"category\": \"Identity and Access Management\", \"descriptionText\": \"It's not recommended to allow read access for all user groups.\", \"descriptionUrl\": \"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#acl\", \"platform\": \"Terraform\" } Organization Filesystem-wise, KICS queries are organized per IaC technology or tool (e.g., terraform, k8s, dockerfile, etc.) and grouped under provider (e.g., aws, gcp, azure, etc.) when applicable. Per each query created, it is mandatory the creation of test cases with, at least, one negative and positive case and a JSON file with data about the expected results, as shown below: [ { \"queryName\": \"All Users Group Gets Read Access\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"line\": 3 } ] Summarizing, the following is the expected file tree for a query: - <technology> |- <provider> | |- <queryfolder> | | |- test | | | |- positive<.ext> | | | |- negative<.ext> | | | |- positive_expected_result.json | | |- metadata.json | | |- query.rego Also, a query can contains multiples positive and negative files, but all cases files names must start with negative or positive and each positive file must be referencered on positive_expected_result.json , as shown below: [ { \"queryName\": \"ELB Sensitive Port Is Exposed To Entire Network\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"line\": 37, \"fileName\": \"positive1.yaml\" }, { \"queryName\": \"ELB Sensitive Port Is Exposed To Entire Network\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"line\": 22, \"fileName\": \"positive2.yaml\" } ] And the file tree should be as follows: - <technology> |- <provider> | |- <queryfolder> | | |- test | | | |- positive1<.ext> | | | |- positive2<.ext> | | | |- negative1<.ext> | | | |- negative2<.ext> | | | |- positive_expected_result.json | | |- metadata.json | | |- query.rego Development of a Query The queries are written in Rego and our internal parser transforms every IaC file that supports into a universal JSON format. This way anyone can start working on a query by picking up a small sample of the vulnerability that the query should target, and convert this sample, that can be a .tf or .yaml file, to our JSON structure JSON. To convert the sample you can run the following command: go run ./cmd/console/main.go -p \"pathToTestData\" -d \"pathToGenerateJson\" So for example, if we wanted to transform a .tf file in ./code/test we could type: go run ./cmd/console/main.go -p \"./src/test\" -d \"src/test/input.json\" After having the .json that will be our Rego input, we can begin to write queries. To test and debug there are two ways: Using Rego playground Install Open Policy Agent extension in VS Code and create a simple folder with a .rego file for the query and a input.json for the sample to test against Testing For a query to be considered complete, it must be compliant with at least one positive and one negative test case. To run the unit tests you can run this command: go test -mod=vendor -v -cover ./... -count=1 Check if the new test was added correctly and if all tests are passing locally.
